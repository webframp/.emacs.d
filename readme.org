* Just Another Emacs Config

Basically just my cobbled together multi machine config. Used
regularly on Mac, Linux and Windows. Began life with some old version
of the [[https://github.com/technomancy/emacs-starter-kit][emacs starter kit]]. Doesn't use that now although I did steal a
few things I had come to expect were always there.

Requires [[https://github.com/cask/cask][Cask]]

There's probably useless vestigial edges, beware.

I typically use emacsclient and use these functions:

#+BEGIN_SRC sh
e()  { emacs -nw $@ }
ed() { emacs --daemon }
ec() { emacsclient -t $@ }
es() { e --daemon=$1 && ec -s $1 }
el() { ps ax | egrep '[Ee]macs' }
ek() { ec -e '(kill-emacs)' -s $1 }
#+END_SRC
